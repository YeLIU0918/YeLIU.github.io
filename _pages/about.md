Ye Liu was born in China. She received her MBBS in Public Health from Guangzhou Medical University (2015–2020) and an MSc in Public Health from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (2020–2021). She is currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Project China.

Her research interests include **pharmacoepidemiology, real-world evidence (RWE), digital health interventions, AI/machine learning** for drug safety, antimicrobial resistance, and implementation science. She has led cluster-randomized trials of pay-it-forward STI testing, designed digital partner-notification and self-sampling interventions, and organized gamified co-creation workshops for STI management.

She has contributed to peer-reviewed publications in PLOS ONE, Lancet Global Health, JAMA Network Open, and Frontiers in Oncology, covering randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and implementation science.
